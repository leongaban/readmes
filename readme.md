## Slide 1: Modern JavaScript Coding Style
- Title: The Evolution of JavaScript: From Classes to Functions
- Content:
  - JavaScript has evolved significantly, especially since ES6, with the introduction of arrow functions, async/await, modules, and template literals.
  - The modern approach favors functional programming, which emphasizes pure functions, higher-order functions, and immutability over class inheritance.
  - Classes are often considered an artifact of object-oriented programming (OOP), which tries to map real-world objects into code. While this has some merit, it often leads to unnecessary complexity in JavaScript.
  - Modern frameworks (like Vue 3) have embraced a more functional approach, which reduces boilerplate code and enhances composability.

## Slide 2: Modern JavaScript Coding Styles and Patterns

- Evolution of JavaScript: From procedural to OOP to functional
- Rise of functional programming in frontend development
- Emphasis on immutability, pure functions, and declarative code
- Growing popularity of hooks and composables in React and Vue

#### Explanation:
- Class-Based:
    - Uses the this keyword extensively, decorators, and inheritance.
    - Code structure is rigid, requires more boilerplate, and can become less intuitive.
- Functional-Based:
    - Cleaner and more concise.
    - Eliminates the need for the this keyword, making code easier to follow and test.
    - Focuses on closures and composability, improving flexibility and code reuse.
